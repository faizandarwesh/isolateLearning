# isolate_learning

This project demonstrates the practical use of isolates in Flutter. It provides a hands-on approach to learning isolates by implementing them in a real-world scenario. Isolates are used to perform time-consuming tasks in the background without blocking the main thread, improving app performance and responsiveness.

Key Features:

Understand the concept of isolates in Dart and Flutter.
Practical examples of isolate usage for background processing.
Simple implementation to help grasp key isolate principles.
Feel free to explore the code and learn how isolates can enhance your Flutter apps!
